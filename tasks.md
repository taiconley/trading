## 12) Strategy Parameter Optimizer (optimizer)

**Overview**: Build a parameter optimization framework in three phases, starting with core functionality and progressively adding advanced features.

### Phase 1: Core Optimization Engine (MVP) 🎯
**Goal**: Basic working optimizer with grid/random search and parallel execution

#### Database Schema (Phase 1):
- [x] Create database migration for optimizer tables
  - [x] `optimization_runs` table - Track optimization jobs
    - Fields: id, strategy_name, algorithm, symbols, timeframe, param_ranges (JSON), objective, status, start_time, end_time, total_combinations, completed_combinations, best_params (JSON), best_score, created_at
  - [x] `optimization_results` table - Store parameter combinations tested
    - Fields: id, run_id (FK), params_json, backtest_run_id (FK), score, sharpe_ratio, total_return, max_drawdown, win_rate, profit_factor, total_trades, created_at
  - [x] Add indexes for efficient querying (run_id, score, created_at)

#### Core Engine:
- [x] Create `backend/src/services/optimizer/engine.py`
  - [x] Parameter space definition and validation
  - [x] Objective function calculation (Sharpe, return, profit factor, etc.)
  - [x] Integration with backtester service
  - [x] Result storage and tracking
  - [x] Progress monitoring
- [x] Create `backend/src/services/optimizer/algorithms/`
  - [x] Base optimizer class
  - [x] Grid Search implementation - exhaustive parameter grid search
  - [x] Random Search implementation - random sampling of parameter space

#### Parallel Execution:
- [x] Create `backend/src/services/optimizer/executor.py`
  - [x] Multiprocessing pool setup (configurable cores)
  - [x] Task distribution and result collection
  - [x] Error handling for failed backtests
  - [x] Resource management and cleanup
  - [x] Fixed database connection handling for multiprocessing

#### Service Layer:
- [x] Create `backend/src/services/optimizer/main.py`
  - [x] CLI interface for command-line optimization
  - [x] REST API with FastAPI
  - [x] On-demand service (not continuously running)
  - [x] Configuration management

#### API Endpoints (Phase 1):
- [x] `POST /optimizations` - Start new optimization
- [x] `GET /optimizations/{id}` - Get optimization status/results
- [x] `GET /optimizations` - List all optimizations
- [x] `GET /optimizations/{id}/results` - Get detailed results (top N combinations)

#### Testing (Phase 1):
- [x] Test: Grid search optimization completes successfully on SMA strategy ✅
- [x] Test: Random search explores parameter space effectively ✅
- [x] Test: Multi-processing utilizes multiple cores efficiently ✅

  - [x] Configurable n_startup_trials for random exploration phase

  - [x] **CRITICAL BUGFIX**: Changed optimizer default lookback from 365 to 100
    - Root cause: Engine only calls `on_bar()` after accumulating `lookback_periods` bars
    - With lookback=365, `on_bar()` called too few times to detect SMA crossovers → 0 trades
    - With lookback=100, sufficient calls for strategies to build history → trades generated ✅
