# Potential Pairs

## Best Candidates
1. **AIN / ESE** – Albany International and ESCO Technologies both sell engineered materials and test systems into aerospace/defense and industrial filtration cycles, giving them shared revenue drivers (Sharpe 3.64, half-life 8.9d, coint p=8.3e-4).
2. **AHCO / SIBN** – AdaptHealth’s home-medical rentals and SI-BONE’s orthopedic implants are each reimbursed by Medicare/Medicaid and tied to elective-procedure volumes, so reimbursement shifts hit both (Sharpe 3.46, half-life 8.6d, coint p=5.8e-4).
3. **ALLO / ANGO** – Allogene Therapeutics and AngioDynamics are oncology-focused medtech/biotech names whose valuations hinge on the same FDA cadence and capital-markets tone (Sharpe 4.10, half-life 11.45d, coint p=5.3e-3).
4. **CTRA / ORA** – Coterra Energy and Ormat Technologies both monetize steady baseload power demand and benefit from lower-carbon mandates, so power price/regulatory shocks influence them together (Sharpe 3.93, half-life 11.7d, coint p=0.0021).

## Macro / Structural Plays
1. **HUM / CINF** – Managed-care and P&C insurers each run huge fixed-income books; book value and EPS move with rate/credit regimes, supporting the spread (Sharpe 4.37, half-life 12.9d, coint p=0.0038).
2. **ENPH / DOW** – Residential-solar demand drives both Enphase inverter shipments and Dow’s specialty polymer films, so IRA incentives and silicon supply jointly impact them (Sharpe 3.50, half-life 8.7d, coint p=6.2e-4).
3. **DE / CME** – Deere’s equipment orders and CME’s ag futures volumes both track crop prices and farmer profitability; droughts and USDA reports move both franchises (Sharpe 3.12, half-life 8.3d, coint p=3.9e-4).
4. **D / JXN** – Dominion Energy and Jackson Financial are yield-heavy names repriced by Treasury moves and credit spreads, making their valuations highly rate-sensitive (Sharpe 3.04, half-life 6.7d, coint p=1.6e-5).
